## SmartWaste hackaton project 

Leveraging the power of data science and machine learning, as part of ITC's Smart-Cities Hackathon that was held for 36 hours,
our data science part of the team (Ariel Drabkin, Gadi G. Ezer, and myself) developed an image recognition feature that allows users to take a photo of an item and 
receive instant feedback on its recyclability and the appropriate bin for disposal with an accuracy of 0.85 and a loss of 0.35 
and full stack part of the team (Yanay Sova, Golan Shoshany, Aseel Sayyad) have built the app where with a simple snap of a photo, 
users can now gain valuable insights into the material composition of trash and learn about their city's disposal regulations.

The repository contains the Inference server code for the SmartWaste hackaton project prediction model
